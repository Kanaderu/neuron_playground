                        Summary
                        This series of posts is an introduction biologically plausible neural networks – it is intended to give readers a taste for computational neuroscience. In this post, I’ll talk about how neurons are modeled, what kinds of computation they can perform, as well as my take on this topic from an engineering perspective.
                        What are Neurons?
                        Neurons are a cells – small membrane-enclosed bodies with diverse and interesting electo-chemical dynamics. They are not the majority of cells in the brain, yet they are (as far as we know) responsible for cognition. Neurons receive, transform, and send electro-chemical signals from one another. Coupled together, in networks, they give rise to complex dynamics: quantitative changes in the size and connectivity of a network gives rise to qualitatively different behavior. 
                        It is useful to view neurons through the lens of computation; however, it is important not to forget that they are components of organisms, subject to the same constraints as other cells. Further their structure is restricted to that which can be built inutero and designed through evolution. This means (1) there are likely other, more capable, cognitive architectures which are not constrained by biology and (2) it is not always easy to see what aspects of neurons are relevant to cognition and what is relevant to their biology or whether it is appropriate to draw the line between the two at all. In terms of computation, neurons are a three step algorithm: (1) neurons integrate (add together) the signals from other neurons, (2) transform this quantity according to some function, and (3)
